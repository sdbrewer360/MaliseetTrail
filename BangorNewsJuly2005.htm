      <p>DANFORTH - Two southern Aroostook County friends whose canoe had capsized 
        in choppy East Grand Lake were found safe early Sunday morning by game 
        wardens on a far shore after a midnight search.</p>
      <p>Michael Hogan, 29, of Smyrna Mills and Briety Dow, 15, whose residence 
        was unclear, survived a night on the water because they wore life jackets, 
        one of the rescuing game wardens said.</p>
      <p>Two wardens who cover northern Washington County, Jeremy Kemp of Carroll 
        Plantation and Paul Farrington of Springfield, conducted the rescue that 
        took place around 4 a.m. </p>
      <p>They had set out in search of the pair soon after midnight, after one 
        of the missing persons' families called in from a lakefront camp and said 
        the two hadn't turned up in the early evening, as expected.</p>
      <p>East Grand Lake is 22 miles long and up to 4 miles wide.</p>
      <p>&quot;We launched with spotlights and GPS [global positioning system],&quot; 
        Kemp said. &quot;It was pretty rough with 2- to 3-foot waves. We searched 
        10 to 15 miles of shoreline and checked the islands in the middle of the 
        lake.&quot;</p>
      <p>The two and their overturned canoe were at last spotted on a far shore 
        that was actually inside Canada's boundary line.</p>
      <p>The canoe had capsized at 6:30 p.m. in the high wind. Although the men 
        managed to right it, it was full of water. They hung on until they floated 
        to shore.</p>
      <p>The canoeists yelled when they spotted the searchlight, but the wardens 
        could not hear them at first over the waves and the wind. But they soon 
        spotted them.</p>
      <p>&quot;You couldn't hear a thing, not even our motor,&quot; Kemp said. 
        &quot;We found them safe and headed back to the boat launch about four 
        miles away.&quot;</p>
      <p>The younger canoeist was borderline hypothermic, he said. </p>
      <p>They both were wearing life jackets at the time of the accident, which 
        &quot;definitely saved their lives,&quot; Kemp said. </p>
