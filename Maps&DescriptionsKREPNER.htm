          map has a special place of honor on this site, it was the first map 
          of the Trial we found back in 2003. That year, if you &quot;googled&quot; 
          Maliseet Trail, all you found were a few pages for hotels that listed 
          the Maliseet (Hiking) Trail as a near by amenity ,and an earlier edition 
          of Mike's map on the Davis Museum web site. You might like to know that 
          one of Mike's canoe packs was used by Matt Hopkinson during the 2005 
          Crossing. I had the pleasure of tumping that pack, yes- tump line included 
          along with conventional shoulder straps on the pack, a few kms and I 
          can tell ya -I want one too. Contact Mike at <a href="mailto:igasisle@midcoast.com">igasisle@midcoast.com</a> 
          to order yours. Matt H. tells me that Mike K. powers his shop with solar 
          power. How cool is that? <a href="PicBentonPortageMatt.htm">Here is 
          link to a pic of Matt showing the tumpline and shoulder straps</a> &quot;</i></font></p>
