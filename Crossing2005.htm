  <p align="center"><font size="4"><b><font size="5">Introduction</font></b></font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">Planning for a 2005 crossing of the Ancient Maliseet 
    Trail, from south of Woodstock NB to Old Town Maine, began in November 2004. 
    The crossing was done over the nine-day period from May 20, to May 29 2005. 
    We owe thanks for the valuable advice received from a number of people. Included 
    among these are: Lane MacIntosh, who first captured our imagination with his 
    own Maliseet Trail Tales based on his research in the 1980s, and from his 
    own involved in the logistics for the 1994 crossing by Martin Paul &amp; Ty 
    Polchies; Nicholas N. Smith, who himself crossed the Trail in 1964 with Dr. 
    Peter L. Paul, and proved a great supporter as we prepared; Bob Miller, who 
    shared with us footage from his 1996 video reenactment of the 1994 crossing; 
    John Heinstein who took the Trail from Benton as far as Eel River Lake in 
    2002; Tony Grant; Phillip Warn Foss; and Elbridge Cleaves. Even with assistance, 
    9 scouting trips were needed to find portage routes and make arrangements 
    with private landowners along the Trail. </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">This was only the third attempt since the 1920s 
    or 1930s to travel the full length of the Trail, and would be the first in 
    that time to be done without the assistance of motor vehicles on the portage 
    routes. Many of the carries were unmarked, unmapped, and unknown. The only 
    existing maps of the Trail's portage routes known to us were sketches published 
    by WF Ganong in 1899.</font></p>

    <b>The Objective</b></font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">The goal of the crossing was to experience the 
    Ancient Maliseet Trail and to leave a digital record of what we would find 
    so as to encourage future use of the Trail. </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">We agreed that we would set aside 9 days to do 
    the crossing and our intent was to go all the way to Old Town ME but making 
    it to the Penobscot River as an acceptable achievement.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">No cars were used once we started and we tried 
    to use the actual portage routes where possible. Three of the canoes were 
    moved over the 15-17 kilometers of portage routes using &quot;portage carts&quot; 
    while the canoe and packs of Paul Meyer and Beth Johnston were carried in 
    the traditional manner. This allowed Beth and Paul to stay closest to what 
    we considered the original portage trails.</font></p>

  <p align="left"><font size="5">The crossing party gathered at the Provincial 
    hiking trail called the Maliseet Trail on Route 165 (Old TCH) just south of 
    Woodstock NB. From here, we hiked in a short distance and camped for the evening.</font></p>

    The Benton Portage and on to Molly's Rock on the Eel River.<br>
    Distance: Portage 5-7 kms Paddle 5kms</b></font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">We walked west to the Saint John River to get 
    a start as close to the site of Ancient Fort Meductic as the now-flooded Meductic 
    flats would allow. At 9:30 am, after a group photo, we turned west to retract 
    our steps to the previous night's camp and then onto Benton and the Eel River. 
    Before departing the encampment, we left a Cuban Cohiba cigar. This act would 
    be repeated until the Cohibas were gone. </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">We walked the hiking trail until it crossed under 
    the new Trans Canada Highway and faded out. When the footpath disappeared, 
    we followed a compass bearing trail towards Benton. Sometime after 2:00pm 
    we exited the woods, walked the last 2-3 kilometers on the road and arrived 
    at the Eel River around 3pm. We gathered our boats, gear, and departed from 
    the Ducks Unlimited dam in Benton by sometime after 3:30pm to start our 24 
    km paddle up the Eel River.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">Molly's Rock came into view around 4:30pm and 
    went ashore for the night. The site offered limited space for camping but 
    it was early in the season so there was enough standing dead wood to supply 
    a fire. </font></p>

    Molly's Rock to a point above Stafford's Mills.<br>
    Paddle 10 kms (estimated)</b></font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">We were quickly on the water about 8 am and just 
    as quickly the lead boats found themselves in a dead-end bog and unable to 
    discern the channel. Flood conditions made the Eel's appearance confusing. 
    </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">The River narrowed, the current gathered strength 
    and our first set of rapids were at a short pinch in the River where eddies 
    near the shore eased our passing up River. The next serious challenge was 
    at Slater's Rips where concerted efforts were requited to move boats through 
    a distinct transition zone under the bridge. Boats began poling and lining 
    to deal with the challenges and we continuing on towards Stafford Mills through 
    a number of rips. </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">We arrived at the Stafford's Mills Bridge a little 
    after 1 pm and portaged around the next section of the River as the topo indicated 
    an end to the rips within a kilometre. At 5:30 pm we made camp a short distance 
    above Stafford's Mills. </font></p>

    </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5"><br>
    After breakfast, Craig cut a 100 metre portage to advance the boats and gear. 
    From this put in it was again necessary to pole the boats. We would encounter 
    three sections requiring poling before arriving at the remains of the earthen 
    dam at Watson's Mill and two sections after Watson's. </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">Big swampy dead waters marked the end of the 
    difficulties ascending the 24 kilometres of the Eel River. We entered the 
    widening sections of the River with a stiffening North East wind at our backs. 
    </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">We arrived at Bear Trap Point a little after 
    noon and stopped for lunch before entering First Eel River Lake. The Lake 
    would require a 4 kilometre crossing with wind that had increased to the point 
    of being a safety consideration. </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">The Lake crossing began a little after 1pm, and 
    with a stop for water from a local well we arrived at the other end of the 
    Lake around 2:30 pm. We took the occasion to check out some new information 
    on the ancient portage trail and were on or way to North Lake by 3:30. We 
    arrived at our North Lake camping site by 6pm.</font></p>

    at Spruce Point and Norway Point. Three of the boats were loaded on carts 
    and Paul and Beth started the traditional crossing to Cleaves Landing a little 
    after 5pm. The cart pullers deviated from the Baskaheagan Trail to arrive 
    at Cleaves Landing on the Baskaheagan by 7:30 pm. Paul and Beth followed the 
    original Baskaheagan Trail in the traditional way to arrive at Cleaves Landing

  <p align="left"><font size="5">That morning, Matt, Mike, and Craig took a canoe 
    on a cart and walked the 3 miles into Danforth to do some grocery shopping. 
    It took the boys and hour to walk a cart into town and, once the shopping 
    was done, the paddle home on the Baskaheagan was only 30 minutes.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">By 11:30 the shopping was done and we started 
    on the Baskaheagan by 11:30am. We arrived at Bean Falls around 2pm, portaged 
    around Bean Falls, and were back on the Baskaheagan by 3:30pm. Soon we were 
    on the Mattawamkeag River and by 5pm we were in camp.</font></p>

  <p align="left"><font size="5">The rains were constant and the temperatures 
    were the coolest of the trip. The paddle through the dead water below Wytopitlock 
    was particularly cold and wet but that continuing North East wind balanced 
    the weather out to be a net gain. The Mattawamkeag Wilderness Park came into 
    sight around 4pm and was repreve with its Adirondack shelters, stacked firewood, 
    and absence of other campers.</font></p>

    Gordon started. Three canoes were again put on portage carts and tracked over 
    the Park's roads to Lower Gordon while Paul and Beth paddled out of camp towards 
    a real-deal portage journey along the trail following the River. All four 
    boats arrived at the top of Lower Gordon Falls about 11:30am. <br>
    We reached the Penobscot River early in the afternoon and made our encampment 
    above Lincoln around 6 pm. We had covered 16 kilometres on the Penobscot and 
    another 14 on the Mattawamkeag.</font></p>

    At Howland we portaged around the hydro dam at River-right and were back on 
    the River by 2:30.The weather began to clear and about 5 pm we camped 20 to 
    25 kilometres above Old Town. This was to be the first encampment where we 
    would enjoy a visible sunset in nine nights.</font></p>

  <p align="left"><font size="5">This day dawned on a changed weather system and 
    the last breakfast of the crossing was under a sunny sky. We hit the River 
    a little before 9am as grey clouds sweep across the southern sky. We made 
    a number of stops and rafted together in the sunny conditions. As the morning 
    progressed, the rain returned.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">When we arrived at Indian Island, we passed on 
    the western channel around the Island to which has a public landing before 
    the hydro dam near Old Town.. Shortly before noon, Matt and Tony were the 
    first of our party to arrive at Old Town landing and were ready with the cameras 
    to capture the landing of the remaining three boats. There were no shortage 
    of smiles as we posed for pictures to mark the conclusion of a crossing without 
    incident, argument, or accident. </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">We walked to the Old Town Canoe Factory to wait 
    for our shuttle home. There we looked at the canoes and watched a great video 
    on the history of the company. Our shuttle driver, Tom Somerville, arrived 
    at 5 pm and when we returned to the landing we had a chance to met Timothy 
    Gould, a warden of the Penobscot Nation. </font></p>
